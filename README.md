=========

Acknowledgement: 
This is more or less a direct copy of the work already done here: http://smithamilli.com/tuts/chat/part-one

Chat Widget: Node, Express, Mongo
=================================
1. Change "http://192.168.2.111:3000/" to where ever you want (i.e. "http://localhost:3000/").

2. Firefox will fail to connect over ws://... but will fallback gracefully after a few seconds.
